SMS VGM Player
==============

This is a "stub" which is able to play VGM files on the Sega Master System. These are logged music from video games.

It is only able to play back music composed for the sound chips it has: the Sega PSG and the YM2413. It also requires you to decompress the VGM file (if it is compressed; most are) and apped it to the ROM.

If you have trouble with playback, try:

1. For compatibility with some flash cartridges, the ROM must be padded to a multiple of 64KB.
2. For compatibility with some emulators, the ROM must be be padded to a minimum of 64KB.
