 No VGM file has been found by
 the player. You have to add a
 file to the player for it to
 work. You can do this by using
 this commandline:

 copy /b vgmplayer.stub+
         vgmfile.vgm output.sms

      (all on one line)
 where:
 ¡Æ vgmplayer.stub is the 16KB
   player file
 ¡Æ vgmfile.vgm is an
   UNCOMPRESSED VGM file
 ¡Æ output.sms is the combined
   file which will be created
